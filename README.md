# IHK_Pruefungsdatei_Manager
School Project for the Management of Exam Files. Windows application that presents a Desktop UI, which allows you to pick a year season and Trade Discipline for the German IHK Exams for CompSci related Apprenticeships.

It then allows you to drag & drop files into the UI for each type of associated document (tasks, solutions, additional material etc.) and choose an output directory. Based on your selection it will automatically copy the files with an easily indexable and searchable file name for each type of document.
